# Purpose of this repostory is to check your programming skill on your BAL

##. Observtions
### I could resolve all node/npm errors even though I am way above >.05
### If you are hard core programmer how much you are drunk, you can still google and find out the solution and fix it given that it is java script related.
### Should be thankful to Git creat0r Linus to give us such a awesome tool
### I am using VSCode to pretend that I am a geek :) but I believe no one can challange IntelliJ even though I pay for it every year.
### At the time of I commit this Go lang is the programming language of the world, I pray deno will over take in future.:)
### Thats it for today. Todo learn Go lang tomorrow.
